# Timeline of Epic Seven's Banners (WIP)
Banner are shown from newest to oldest with some important events

# Features:
- Rate up stats by attribute / role / characters
- Saving user pulls (Currently disabled but is in place)
- Rate up banners have the background color of their attribute
- Camping simulator database is used to retrive character data
- Verticale timeline (Needs some design improvments)
- Auto updater for Rate Up Banners (Stove news parser, works for now), mystic banners need manual updating for now

# Todo:
- Add user pull record for each banner
- Add all 5* for each mystic rotation
- General stats (character with heighest/least rerun count), and user stats (pity%, average # of pulls)
