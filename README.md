To keep a smooth experience for the user HeroDatabase.json is automatically updated by a bot when a new character is added to the API

HeroDatabase.json is loaded during website startup with a get request: "https://ceciliabot.github.io/HeroDatabase.json"

# Todo:
1. Improve speed with huge teams and 0/1 locked hero and no advanced settings;
2. Most saved teams ?
