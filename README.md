E7 Camping Simulator

To keep a smooth experience for the user HeroDatabase.json is automatically updated by a bot when a new character is added to the API

HeroDatabase.json is loaded during website startup with a get request: "https://ceciliabot.github.io/HeroDatabase.json"

At boot if cannot connect to EpicSevenDB API english character names will be used instead of the selected language to prevent the page from not booting at all

# Todo:
1. Remove duplicate heroes in the same team: "Lorina" & "Commander Lorina" etc..;
2. Most used team sorted by Boss or Difficulty.
